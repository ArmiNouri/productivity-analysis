A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. #AmericanSpirit
I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the #AmericanSpirit. #JointAddress
We are one people  with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood.We all salute the same flag.And we are all made by the same God.
Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. #AmericanSpirit #JointAddress
We want harmony and stability  not war and conflict. We want peace  wherever peace can be found. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit
Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. #AmericanSpirit
My budget will increase funding for our Veterans. Our Veterans have delivered for this nation. Now we MUST deliver for them. #JointAddress
We must provide the men and women of the U.S. Military with the tools they need to prevent war and – if they must – TO FIGHT AND TO WIN.
We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit
EVERY American child should be able to grow up in a safe community  to attend a great school  and to have access to a high-paying job.
Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling for an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth.
The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines! #JointAddress
We must ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage. #JointAddress
Obamacare is collapsing – and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice  it is a necessity. #JointAddress
I am calling on Congress to REPEAL & REPLACE OBAMACARE with reforms that expand choice  increase access  lower costs & provide better care.
The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding that will be guided by two core principles: Buy American  and Hire American!
I believe in free trade  but it also must be FAIR TRADE. I'm not going to let our great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore!
My team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies & provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
We must restart the engine of the American economy  making it easier for companies to do business in the US & much harder for them to leave!
Solving these problems will require us to tap into the #AmericanSpirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our storied history.
In the last 8 years  the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. #JointAddress
It is not compassionate  but reckless  to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. #JointAddress
As we speak  we are removing gang members  drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. #JointAddress
My Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. #JointAddress
We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country & poisoning our youth  and we will expand treatment for those who have become addicted.
I have issued a new directive that American pipelines must be made with American steel. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit
Above all else  we will keep our promises to the American People. #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit
America must put its own citizens first  because only then can we truly Make America Great Again! #JointAddress #AmericanSpirit
A surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the #AmericanSpirit
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength  and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. #JointAddress
We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. #JointAddress
